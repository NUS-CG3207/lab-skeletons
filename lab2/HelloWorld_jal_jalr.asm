# This sample program prints "Welcome to CG3207" in response to "A\r" (A+Enter) received from Console. There should be a sufficient time gap between the press of 'A' and '\r' 
# if the processor is run at a low freq.
# Important: This version requires full jal and jalr implementation (including the link functionality)

# Total number of instructions should not exceed 128 (127 excluding the last line 'halt B halt').

# Note: see the wiki regarding the pseudoinstructions li and la. 
# Pseudoinstructions may be implemented using more than one actual instruction. See the assembled code in the Execute tab of RARS
# You can also use the actual register numbers directly. For example, instead of s6 (ABI name), you can write x22, but the former is preferred

### beginning of main program
main:   
	li s6, LSB_MASK			# A mask for extracting out the LSB to check for '\0'
	la s7, LEDS			# LEDs
	la s8, CONSOLE_OUT_ready	# UART ready for output flag

	beq t1, zero, WAIT_A	# go back and wait if there is no new character. Could have been written as pseudoinstruction beqz t1, WAIT_A
	lw t0, (s10)		# read UART (first character. 'A' - 0x41 expected)
ECHO_A:
	lw t1, (s8)		# check if the UART is ready to be written
	beqz t1, ECHO_A
	sw t0, (s10)		# echo received character to the console
	sw t0, (s11)		# show received character (ASCII) on the 7-Seg display
	sw t0, (s7)		# show received character (ASCII) on the LEDs
	li t2, 'A'
	bne t0, t2, WAIT_A	# not 'A'. Continue waiting
WAIT_CR:			# 'A' received. Need to wait for '\r' (Carriage Return - CR).
	lw t1, (s9)		# read the new character flag
	beqz t1, WAIT_CR	# go back and wait if there is no new character

	sw t0, (s7)		# show received character (ASCII) on the LEDs
	beq t0, t2, WAIT_CR 	# perhaps the user is trying again before completing the pervious attempt, or 'A' was repeated. Just a '\r' needed as we already got an 'A'
	li t1, '\r'
	bne t0, t1, WAIT_A	# not the correct pattern. try all over again.
				# "A\r" received. Call PRINT_S subroutine
	la a0, string1		# a0 stores the value to be displayed. This is the argument passed to PRINT_S

### beginning of PRINT_S function

DONT_RETURN:
	sw t1, (s10) 		# write to UART the Byte(4-t2) of the original word (composed of 4 characters) in (7:0) of the word to be written (remember, we can only write words, and LEDs/UART displays only (7:0) of the written word)

	li t1, 1		# note : no subi instruction in RV
	sub t2, t2, t1		# decrement the loop counter

	j PRINT_S		# Specify zero as rd as we do not want to overwrite ra.
### end of PRINT_S function

halt:	
	j halt			# infinite loop to halt computation. A program should not "terminate" without an operating system to return control to
				# keep halt: j halt as the last line of your code, though not strictly necessary if there is an infinite loop somewhere.
